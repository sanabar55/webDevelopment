<h3>The tallest animals...</h3>

	<p> Our first stop was the African Plains exhibit. Towering giraffes greeted us, their long necks swaying as they munched on leaves. Amir squinted through his binoculars, voicing factoids he had memorized from his animal books. "Did you know their tongues are purple? It helps them avoid sunburn!"

	<p>At the Philadelphia Zoo, the giraffes are housed in an expansive African Plains exhibit designed to mimic their natural savanna habitat. Tall acacia trees, native to their homeland, are scattered throughout their enclosure, and a large waterhole provides a serene spot for these gentle giants to drink. The sight of giraffes ambling across the grassy plains is nothing short of mesmerizing.

<p>Giraffes are the tallest land animals on Earth, with their height reaching up to 18 feet. Their long, slender necks contain only seven vertebrae, the same number as many other mammals, including humans, but each vertebra can be over 10 inches long! Their height gives them a significant advantage, allowing them to browse on leaves and twigs that most other herbivores can't reach.
